How do you disable a user account on a Mac?
You can disable a user account by setting their shell to /usr/bin/false. Either run: 
	<span style="color: #3366ff;">chsh -s /usr/bin/false <username></span>
	or change it in Users & Groups â†’ Advanced Options. To change it back, 
	run <span style="color: #3366ff;">chsh -s /bin/bash <username></span> . It doesn't apply to GUI logins?

###pwpolicy can both disable and enable users, without losing their password

To disable the user
<span style="color: #3366ff;">pwpolicy -u username disableuser</span>

To enable the user
<span style="color: #3366ff;">pwpolicy -u username enableuser</span>

Use dscl to hide the user so they don't show on login:
<span style="color: #3366ff;">sudo dscl . create /Users/username IsHidden 1</span>

To show a hidden user
<span style="color: #3366ff;">sudo dscl . create /Users/username IsHidden 0</span>
